# Loan Management System 

This is a **console-based Loan Management System** built with **Java, JDBC, and MySQL**.  
It started as a way to practice database design and JDBC, but turned into a mini project that covers the **entire loan lifecycle**: from customer registration to loan approval, EMI calculation, repayments, and reporting.

---

##  What it does
-  **Register customers** with basic details  
-  **Apply for loans** (principal, interest rate, term)  
-  **Admin approves or rejects** loan requests  
-  **Calculate EMIs** and split into principal + interest  
-  **Record repayments** and update outstanding balance automatically  
-  **Generate reports** for total loans, collections, and defaults  
-  Supports full **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  

---

##  How itâ€™s built
- **Java (8+)** â†’ main application logic  
- **JDBC** â†’ database interaction  
- **MySQL** â†’ backend database  
- **SQL** â†’ schema, indexes, and transactions

##  Getting started
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/baseplate911/loan-management-system.git
   cd loan-management-system
Download MySQL Connector/J
 and drop the .jar file into the lib/ folder.

Create the database and tables:

mysql -u root -p < sql/schema.sql


Update DBConnection.java with your MySQL username & password.

Compile & run:

mkdir out
javac -cp "lib/mysql-connector-j-8.0.xx.jar;." -d out -sourcepath src src/com/example/loan/App.java
java -cp "lib/mysql-connector-j-8.0.xx.jar;out" com.example.loan.App

 Demo workflow

Register a customer

Apply for a loan

Admin approves â†’ EMI is calculated

Make a repayment â†’ outstanding balance updates

View reports â†’ track collections & defaults

 Future ideas
